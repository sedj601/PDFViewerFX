Since in early ages commercial activities were based on barter system, record keeping was not a necessity. The Industrial Revolution of 19th century along with rapid rise in population, paved way for the development of commercial activities, mass production and credit terms. Thus recording of business transaction has become an important feature. In recent years with the change of technologies and marketing along with stiff competition, accounting system has undergone remarkable changes. 1.1 Need and Importance of Accounting When a person starts a business, whether large or small, his main aim is to earn profit. He receives money from certain sources like sale of goods, interest on bank deposits etc. He has to spend money on certain items like purchase of goods, salary, rent, etc. These activities take place during the normal course of his business. He would naturally be anxious at the year end, to know the progress of his business. Business transactions are numerous, that it is not possible to recall his memory as to how the money had been earned and spent. At the same time, if he had noted down his incomes and expenditures, he can readily get the required information. Hence, the details of the business transactions have to be recorded in a clear and systematic manner to get answers easily and accurately for the following questions at any time he likes. i. What has happened to his investment? ii. What is the result of the business transactions? iii. What are the earnings and expenses? ","2 iv. How much amount is receivable from customers to whom goods have been sold on credit? v. How much amount is payable to suppliers on account of credit purchases? vi. What are the nature and value of assets possessed by the business concern? vii. What are the nature and value of liabilities of the business concern? These and several other questions are answered with the help of accounting. The need for recording business transactions in a clear and systematic manner is the basis which gives rise to Book-keeping. 1.2. Book-keeping Book-keeping is that branch of knowledge which tells us how to keep a record of business transactions. It is often routine and clerical in nature. It is important to note that only those transactions related to business which can be expressed in terms of money are recorded. The activities of book-keeping include recording in the journal, posting to the ledger and balancing of accounts. 1.2.1 Definition R.N. Carter says, “Book-keeping is the science and art of correctly recording in the books of account all those business transactions that result in the transfer of money or money’s worth”. 1.2.2 Objectives The objectives of book-keeping are i. to have permanent record of all the business transactions. ii. to keep records of income and expenses in such a way that the net profit or net loss may be calculated. iii. to keep records of assets and liabilities in such a way that the financial position of the business may be ascertained. iv. to keep control on expenses with a view to minimise the same in order to maximise profit. v. to know the names of the customers and the amount due from them. vi. to know the names of suppliers and the amount due to them. vii. to have important information for legal and tax purposes. 1.2.3 Advantages From the above objectives of book-keeping, the following advantages can be noted ","3 i. Permanent and Reliable Record: Book-keeping provides permanent record for all business transactions, replacing the memory which fails to remember everything. ii. Arithmetical Accuracy of the Accounts: With the help of book keeping trial balance can be easily prepared. This is used to check the arithmetical accuracy of accounts. iii. Net Result of Business Operations: The result (Profit or Loss) of business can be correctly calculated. iv. Ascertainment of Financial Position: It is not enough to know the profit or loss; the proprietor should have a full picture of his financial position in business. Once the full picture (say for a year) is known, this helps him to plan for the next year’s business. v. Ascertainment of the Progress of Business: When a proprietor prepares financial statements evey year, he will be in a position to compare the statements. This will enable him to ascertain the growth of his business. Thus book keeping enables a long range planning of business activities besides satisfying the short term objective of calculation of annual profits or losses. vi. Calculation of Dues : For certain transactions payments may be made later. Therefore, the businessman has to know how much he has to pay others. vii. Control over Assets: In the course of business, the proprietor acquires various assets like building, machines, furnitures, etc. He has to keep a check over them and find out their values year after year. viii. Control over Borrowings: Many businessmen borrow from banks and other sources. These loans are repayable. Just as he must have a control over assets, he should have control over liabilities. ix. Identifying Do’s and Dont’s : Book keeping enables the proprietor to make an intelligent and periodic analysis of various aspects of the business such as purchases, sales, expenditures and incomes. From such analysis, it will be possible to focus his attention on what should be done and what should not be done to enhance his profit earning capacity. x. Fixing the Selling Price : In fixing the selling price, the businessmen have to consider many aspects of accounting information such as cost of production, cost of purchases and other expenses. Accounting information is essential in determining selling prices. xi. Taxation: Businessmen pay sales tax, income tax, etc. The tax authorities require them to submit their accounts. For this purpose, they have to maintain a record of all their business transactions. ","4 xii. Management Decision-making: Planning, reviewing, revising, controlling and decision-making functions of the management are well aided by book-keeping records and reports. xiii. Legal Requirements: Claims against and for the firm in relation to outsiders can be confirmed and established by producing the records as evidence in the court. 1.3 Accounting Book-keeping does not present a clear financial picture of the state of affairs of a business. When one has to make a judgement regarding the financial position of the firm, the information contained in these books of accounts has to be analysed and interpreted. It is with the purpose of giving such information that accounting came into being. Accounting is considered as a system which collects and processes financial information of a business. These informations are reported to the users to enable them to make appropriate decisions. 1.3.1 Definition American Accounting Association defines accounting as “the process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decision by users of the information”. 1.3.2 Objectives The main objectives of accounting are i. to maintain accounting records. ii. to calculate the result of operations. iii. to ascertain the financial position. iv. to communicate the information to users. 1.3.3 Process The process of accounting as per the above definition is given below: Business transactions (monetary value) Information to Users Identifying Recording Classifying Summarising Analysing Interpreting Communicating Input Process Output In order to accomplish its main objective of communicating information to the users, accounting embraces the following functions. ","5 i. Identifying: Identifying the business transactions from the source documents. ii. Recording: The next function of accounting is to keep a systematic record of all business transactions, which are identified in an orderly manner, soon after their occurrence in the journal or subsidiary books. iii. Classifying: This is concerned with the classification of the recorded business transactions so as to group the transactions of similar type at one place. i.e., in ledger accounts. In order to verify the arithmetical accuracy of the accounts, trial balance is prepared. iv. Summarising : The classified information available from the trial balance are used to prepare profit and loss account and balance sheet in a manner useful to the users of accounting information. v. Analysing: It establishes the relationship between the items of the profit and loss account and the balance sheet. The purpose of analysing is to identify the financial strength and weakness of the business. It provides the basis for interpretation. vi. Interpreting: It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship so established by the analysis. Interpretation should be useful to the users, so as to enable them to take correct decisions. vii. Communicating: The results obtained from the summarised, analysed and interpreted information are communicated to the interested parties. 1.3.4 Meaning of Accounting Cycle An accounting cycle is a complete sequence of accounting process, that begins with the recording of business transactions and ends with the preparation of final accounts. Accounting Cycle Balance Sheet (Closing) Balance Sheet (Opening) Profit & Loss Account Trading Account Trial Balance Transactions Journal Ledger ","6 When a businessman starts his business activities, he records the day-to- day transactions in the Journal. From the journal the transactions move further to the ledger where accounts are written up. Here, the combined effect of debit and credit pertaining to each account is arrived at in the form of balances. To prove the accuracy of the work done, these balances are transferred to a statement called trial balance. Preparation of trading and profit and loss account is the next step. The balancing of profit and loss account gives the net result of the business transactions. To know the financial position of the business concern balance sheet is prepared at the end. These transactions which have completed the current accounting year, once again come to the starting point – the journal – and they move with new transactions of the next year. Thus, this cyclic movement of the transactions through the books of accounts (accounting cycle) is a continuous process. 1.4 Accountancy, Accounting and Book-keeping A ccountancy refers to a systematic knowledge of accounting. It explains “why to do” and “how to do” of various aspects of accounting. It tells us why and how to prepare the books of accounts and how to summarize the accounting information and communicate it to the interested parties. Accounting refers to the actual process of preparing and presenting the accounts. In other words, it is the art of putting the academic knowledge of accountancy into practice. Book-keeping is a part of accounting and is concerned with record keeping or maintenance of books of accounts. It is often routine and clerical in nature. 1.4.1 Relationship between Accountancy, Accounting and Book-keeping Book-keeping provides the basis for accounting and it is complementary to accounting process. Accounting begins where book-keeping ends. Accountancy includes accounting and book-keeping. The terms Accounting and Accountancy are used synonymously. This relationship can be easily understood with the help of the following diagram. A C C O U N T A N C Y A C C O U N T I N G B o o k - k e e p i n g ","7 1.4.2 Distinction between Book-keeping and Accounting In general the following are the differences between book-keeping and accounting. Sl.No. Basis of Distinction Book-keeping Accounting 1. Scope Recording and maintenance of books of accounts. It is not only recording and maintenance of books of accounts but also includes analysis, interpreting and communicating the information. 2. Stage Primary stage. Secondary stage. 3. Objective To maintain systematic records of business transactions. To ascertain the net result of the business operation. 4. Nature Often routine and clerical in nature. Analytical and executive in nature. 5. Responsibility A book-keeper is responsible for recording business transactions. An accountant is also responsible for the work of a book-keeper. 6. Supervision The book-keeper does not supervise and check the work of an Accountant. An accountant supervises and checks the work of the book-keeper. 7. Staff involved Work is done by the junior staff of the organisation. Senior staff performs the accounting work. 1.5 Users of Accounting Information The basic objective of accounting is to provide information which is useful for persons and groups inside and outside the organisation. I. Internal users: Internal users are those individuals or groups who are within the organisation like owners, management, employees and trade unions. II. External users: External users are those individuals or groups who are outside the organisation like creditors, investors, banks and other lending institutions, present and potential investors, Government, tax authorities, regulatory agencies and researchers. ","8 The users and their need for information are as follows: Users Need for Information Internal i. Owners ii. Management iii. Employees and Trade unions To know the profitability and financial soundness of the business. To take prompt decisions to manage the business efficiently. To form judgement about the earning capacity of the business since their remuneration and bonus depend on it. External i. Creditors, banks and other lending institutions ii. Present investors To determine whether the principal and the interest thereof will be paid in when due. To know the position, progress and prosperity of the business in order to ensure the safety of their investment. iii. Potential investors iv. Government and Tax authorities v. Regulatory agencies vi. Researchers To decide whether to invest in the business or not. To know the earnings in order to assess the tax liabilities of the business. To evaluate the business operation under the regulatory legislation. To use in their research work. Users of Accounting Information Owners Management Employees and Trade Unions Creditors, Banks & Lending Institutions Present Investors Potential Investors Government and Tax Authorities Regulatory Agencies Researchers Accounting Information ","9 1.6 Branches of Accounting Increased scale of business operations has made the management function more complex. This has given raise to specialised branches in accounting. The main branches of accounting are Financial Accounting, Cost Accounting and Management Accounting. 1.6.1 Financial Accounting : It is concerned with recording of business transactions in the books of accounts in such a way that operating result of a particular period and financial position on a particular date can be known. 1.6.2 Cost Accounting It relates to collection, classification and ascertainment of the cost of production or job undertaken by the firm. 1.6.3 Management Accounting It relates to the use of accounting data collected with the help of financial accounting and cost accounting for the purpose of policy formulation, planning, control and decision making by the management. Branches of Accounting Accounting Financial Accounting Cost Accounting Management Accounting 1.7 Basic Accounting Terms The understanding of the subject becomes easy when one has the knowledge of a few important terms of accounting. Some of them are explained below. 1.7.1 Transactions Transactions are those activities of a business, which involve transfer of money or goods or services between two persons or two accounts. For example , purchase of goods, sale of goods, borrowing from bank, lending of money, salaries paid, rent paid, commission received and dividend received. Transactions are of two types, namely, cash and credit transactions. Cash Transaction is one where cash receipt or payment is involved in the transaction. For example , When Ram buys goods from Kannan paying the price of goods by cash immediately, it is a cash transaction. Credit Transaction is one where cash is not involved immediately but will be paid or received later. In the above example, if Ram, does not pay cash immediately but promises to pay later, it is credit transaction. ","10 1.7.2 Proprietor A person who owns a business is called its proprietor. He contributes capital to the business with the intention of earning profit. 1.7.3 Capital It is the amount invested by the proprietor/s in the business.

It records business transactions taking place during the accounting period. Accounting communicates the result of the business transactions in the form of final accounts. With a view to make the accounting results understood in the same sense by all interested parties, certain accounting assumptions, concepts and principles have been developed over a course of period. 2.1 Basic Assumptions The basic assumptions of accounting are like the foundation pillars on which the structure of accounting is based. The four basic assumptions are as follows: 2.1.1 Accounting Entity Assumption According to this assumption, business is treated as a unit or entity apart from its owners, creditors and others. In other words, the proprietor of a business concern is always considered to be separate and distinct from the business which he controls. All the business transactions are recorded in the books of accounts from the view point of the business. Even the proprietor is treated as a creditor to the extent of his capital. 2.1.2 Money Measurement Assumption In accounting, only those business transactions and events which are of financial nature are recorded. For example, when Sales Manager is not on good terms with Production Manager, the business is bound to suffer. This fact will not be recorded, because it cannot be measured in terms of money. ","16 2.1.3 Accounting Period Assumption The users of financial statements need periodical reports to know the operational result and the financial position of the business concern. Hence it becomes necessary to close the accounts at regular intervals. Usually a period of 365 days or 52 weeks or 1 year is considered as the accounting period. 2.1.4 Going Concern Assumption As per this assumption, the business will exist for a long period and transactions are recorded from this point of view. There is neither the intention nor the necessity to wind up the business in the foreseeable future. 2.2 Basic Concepts of Accounting These concepts guide how business transactions are reported. On the basis of the above four assumptions the following concepts (principles) of accounting have been developed. 2.2.1 Dual Aspect Concept Dual aspect principle is the basis for Double Entry System of book-keeping. All business transactions recorded in accounts have two aspects - receiving benefit and giving benefit. For example, when a business acquires an asset (receiving of benefit) it must pay cash (giving of benefit). 2.2.2 Revenue Realisation Concept According to this concept, revenue is considered as the income earned on the date when it is realised. Unearned or unrealised revenue should not be taken into account. The realisation concept is vital for determining income pertaining to an accounting period. It avoids the possibility of inflating incomes and profits. 2.2.3 Historical Cost Concept Under this concept, assets are recorded at the price paid to acquire them and this cost is the basis for all subsequent accounting for the asset. For example, if a piece of land is purchased for Rs.5,00,000 and its market value is Rs.8,00,000 at the time of preparing final accounts the land value is recorded only for Rs.5,00,000. Thus, the balance sheet does not indicate the price at which the asset could be sold for. 2.2.4 Matching Concept Matching the revenues earned during an accounting period with the cost associated with the period to ascertain the result of the business concern is called the matching concept. It is the basis for finding accurate profit for a period which can be safely distributed to the owners. ","17 2.2.5 Full Disclosure Concept Accounting statements should disclose fully and completely all the significant information. Based on this, decisions can be taken by various interested parties. It involves proper classification and explanations of accounting information which are published in the financial statements. 2.2.6 Verifiable and Objective Evidence Concept This principle requires that each recorded business transactions in the books of accounts should have an adequate evidence to support it. For example, cash receipt for payments made. The documentary evidence of transactions should be free from any bias. As accounting records are based on documentary evidence which are capable of verification, it is universally acceptable. 2.3 Modifying Principles To make the accounting information useful to various interested parties, the basic assumptions and concepts discussed earlier have been modified. These modifying principles are as under. 2.3.1 Cost Benefit Principle This modifying principle states that the cost of applying a principle should not be more than the benefit derived from it. If the cost is more than the benefit then that principle should be modified. 2.3.2 Materiality Principle The materiality principle requires all relatively relevant information should be disclosed in the financial statements. Unimportant and immaterial information are either left out or merged with other items. 2.3.3 Consistency Principle The aim of consistency principle is to preserve the comparability of financial statements. The rules, practices, concepts and principles used in accounting should be continuously observed and applied year after year. Comparisons of financial results of the business among different accounting period can be significant and meaningful only when consistent practices were followed in ascertaining them. For example, depreciation of assets can be provided under different methods, whichever method is followed, it should be followed regularly. 2.3.4 Prudence )Conservatism( Principle Prudence principle takes into consideration all prospective losses but leaves all prospective profits. The essence of this principle is “anticipate no profit and provide for all possible losses”. For example, while valuing stock in trade, market price or cost price whichever is less is considered.

Accounting Period 4. Going Concern Modifying Principles 1. Cost Benefit 2. Materiality 3. Consistency 4. Prudence Frame Work of Accounting 2.4 Accounting Standards To promote world-wide uniformity in published accounts, the International Accounting Standards Committee )IASC( has been set up in June 1973 with nine nations as founder members. The purpose of this committee is to formulate and publish in public interest, standards to be observed in the presentation of audited financial statements and to promote their world-wide acceptance and observance. IASC exist to reduce the differences between different countries’ accounting practices. This process of harmonisation will make it easier for the users and preparers of financial statement to operate across international boundaries. In our country, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has constituted Accounting Standard Board (ASB) in 1977.

","21 CHAPTER - 3 BASIC ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES - I DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM OF BOOK KEEPING Learning Objectives After learning this chapter you will be able to:  understand the Meaning, Features and Advantages of Double Entry System  know the Meaning and Types of Accounts.  identify the Accounting Rules. ________________________________________________________________ Recording of business transactions has been in vogue in all countries of the world. In India, maintenance of accounts was practised not in such a developed form as we have today. Kautilya’s famous Arthasastra not only relates to Politics and Economics, but also explains the art of account keeping in a separate chapter. Written in 4th century BC, the book gives details about account keeping, methods of supervising and checking of accounts and also about the distinction between capital and revenue, income and expenses etc. Double entry system was introduced to the business world by an Italian merchant named Lucas Pacioli in 1494 A.D. Though the system of recording business transactions in a systematic manner has originated in Italy, it was perfected in England and other European countries during the 18th century only i.e., after the Industrial Revolution. Many countries have adopted this system today. 3.1 Double Entry System There are numerous transactions in a business concern. Each transaction, when closely analysed, reveals two aspects. One aspect will be “receiving aspect” or “incoming aspect” or “expenses/loss aspect”. This is termed as the “Debit aspect” . The other aspect will be “giving aspect” or “outgoing aspect” or “income/gain aspect”. This is termed as the “Credit aspect” . These two aspects namely “Debit aspect” and “Credit aspect” form the basis of Double Entry System. The double entry system is so named since it records both the aspects of a transaction. ","22 In short, the basic principle of this system is, for every debit, there must be a corresponding credit of equal amount and for every credit, there must be a corresponding debit of equal amount. 3.1.1 Definition According to J.R.Batliboi “Every business transaction has a two-fold effect and that it affects two accounts in opposite directions and if a complete record were to be made of each such transaction, it would be necessary to debit one account and credit another account. It is this recording of the two fold effect of every transaction that has given rise to the term Double Entry System”. 3.1.2 Features i. Every business transaction affects two accounts. ii. Each transaction has two aspects, i.e., debit and credit. iii.  It is based upon accounting assumptions concepts and principles. iv.  Helps in preparing trial balance which is a test of arithmetical accuracy in accounting. v. Preparation of final accounts with the help of trial balance. 3.1.3 Approaches of Recording There are two approaches for recording a transaction. I. Accounting Equation Approach II. Traditional Approach I. Accounting Equation Approach This approach is also called as the American Approach. Under this method transactions are recorded based on the accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital This will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. II. Traditional Approach This approach is also called as the British Approach . Recording of business transactions under this method are formed on the basis of the existence of two aspects (debit and credit) in each of the transactions. All the business transactions are recorded in the books of accounts under the ‘Double Entry System’. 3.1.4 Advantages The advantages of this system are as follows: i. Scientific system: This is the only scientific system of recording business transactions. It helps to attain the objectives of accounting. ","23 ii. Complete record of transactions: This system maintains a complete record of all business transactions. iii. A check on the accuracy of accounts: By the use of this system the accuracy of the accounting work can be established by the preparation of trial balance. iv. Ascertainment of profit or loss: The profit earned or loss occured during a period can be ascertained by the preparation of profit and loss account. v. Knowledge of the financial position : The financial position of the concern can be ascertained at the end of each period through the preparation of balance sheet. vi. Full details for control: This system permits accounts to be kept in a very detailed form, and thereby provides sufficient informations for the purpose of control. vii. Comparative study : The results of one year may be compared with those of previous years and the reasons for change may be ascertained. viii. Helps in decision making: The mangement may be able to obtain sufficient information for its work, especially for making decisions. Weaknesses can be detected and remedial measures may be applied. ix. Detection of fraud: The systematic and scientific recording of business transactions on the basis of this system minimises the chances of fraud. 3.2 Account Every transaction has two aspects and each aspect has an account. It is stated that ‘an account is a summary of relevant transactions at one place relating to a particular head’ . 3.2.1 Classification of Accounts Transactions can be divided into three categories. i. Transactions relating to individuals and firms ii. Transactions relating to properties, goods or cash iii. Transactions relating to expenses or losses and incomes or gains. Therefore, accounts can also be classified into Personal, Real and Nominal. The classification may be illustrated as follows ","24 Accounts Personal Natural Real Nominal Artificial Representative Impersonal Tangible Intangible I. Personal Accounts : The accounts which relate to persons. Personal accounts include the following. i. Natural Persons : Accounts which relate to individuals. For example, Mohan’s A/c, Shyam’s A/c etc. ii. Artificial persons : Accounts which relate to a group of persons or firms or institutions. For example, HMT Ltd., Indian Overseas Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Cosmopolitan club etc. iii. Representative Persons: Accounts which represent a particular person or group of persons. For example, outstanding salary account, prepaid insurance account, etc. The business concern may keep business relations with all the above personal accounts, because of buying goods from them or selling goods to them or borrowing from them or lending to them. Thus they become either Debtors or Creditors. The proprietor being an individual his capital account and his drawings account are also personal accounts. II. Impersonal Accounts: All those accounts which are not personal accounts. This is further divided into two types viz. Real and Nominal accounts. i. Real Accounts: Accounts relating to properties and assets which are owned by the business concern. Real accounts include tangible and intangible accounts. For example, Land, Building, Goodwill, Purchases, etc. ii.  Nominal Accounts: These accounts do not have any existence, form or shape. They relate to incomes and expenses and gains and losses of a business concern. For example, Salary Account, Dividend Account, etc. ","25 Illustration : 1 Classify the following items into Personal, Real and Nominal Accounts. 1. Capital 2. Sales 3. Drawings 4.

Accounting identifies only those transactions and events which involve money. They should be of financial character. Accountant does so by sorting out various cash memos, invoices, bills, receipts and vouchers. In the accounting process, the first step is the recording of transactions in the books of accounts. The origin of a transaction is derived from the source document. 4.1 Source Documents Source documents are the evidences of business transactions which provide information about the nature of the transaction, the date, the amount and the parties involved in it. Transactions are recorded in the books of accounts when they actually take place and are duly supported by source documents. According to the verifiable objective principle of Accounting , each transaction recorded in the books of accounts should have adequate proof to support it. These supporting documents are the written and authentic proof of the correctness of the recorded transactions. These documents are required for audit and tax assessment. They also serve as the legal evidence in case of a dispute. The following are the most common source documents. 4.1.1 Cash Memo When a trader sells goods for cash, he gives a cash memo and when he purchases goods for cash, he receives a cash memo. Details regarding the items, quantity, rate and the price are mentioned in the cash memo. ","29 Cash Memo Vinoth Watch Co., 135, South Usman Road, Thyagaraya Nagar, Chennai-17.

Thus, there must be a source document for each transaction recorded in the books of accounts. Note : The formats of the source documents are given above, only to know the details but not for the preparation. 4.2 Accounting Equation The source document is the origin of a transaction and it initiates the accounting process, whose starting point is the accounting equation. Accounting equation is based on dual aspect concept (Debit and Credit). It emphasizes on the fact that every transaction has a two sided effect i.e., on the assets and claims on assets. Always the total claims (those of outsiders and of the proprietors) will be equal to the total assets of the business concern. The claims are also known as equities, are of two types: i.) Owners equity (Capital); ii.) Outsiders’ equity (Liabilities). Assets = Equities Assets = Capital + Liabilities (A = C+L) Capital = Assets – Liabilities (C = A–L) Liabilities = Assets – Capital (L = A–C) 4.2.1 Effect of Transactions on Accounting Equation : I llustration 1 If the capital of a business is Rs.3,00,000 and other liabilities are Rs.2,00,000, calculate the total assets of the business. Solution Assets = Capital + Liabilities Capital + Liabilities = Assets Rs. 3,00,000 + Rs.2,00,000 = Rs.5,00,000 I llustration 2 If the total assets of a business are Rs.3,60,000 and capital is Rs.2,00,000, calculate liabilities. Solution Assets = Capital + Liabilities Liabilities = Assets – Capital Assets – Capital = Liabilities Rs. 3,60,000 – Rs. 2,00,000 = Rs. 1,60,000 ","35 I llustration 3 If the total assets of a business are Rs.4,50,000 and outside liabilities are Rs.2,50,000, calculate the capital. Solution: Capital = Assets – Liabilities Assets – Liabilities = Capital Rs. 4,50,000 – Rs. 2,50,000  = Rs.2,00,000 I llustration - 4 Transaction 1: Murugan started business with Rs.50,000 as capital. The business unit has received assets totalling Rs.50,000 in the form of cash and the claims against the firm are also Rs.50,000 in the form of capital. The transaction can be expressed in the form of an accounting equation as follows: Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash = Capital + Liabilities Rs. 50,000  = Rs. 50,000 + 0 Transaction 2: Murugan purchased furniture for cash Rs.5,000. The cash is reduced by Rs,5,000 but a new asset (furniture) of the same amount has been acquired. This transaction decreases one asset (cash) and at the same time increases the other asset (furniture) with the same amount, leaving the total of the assets of the business unchanged. The accounting equation now is as follows: Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash + Furniture = Capital + Liabilities Transaction 1 50,000 + 0 = 50,000 + 0 Transaction 2 (–) 5,000 + 5,000 = 0 + 0 Equation 45,000 + 5,000 = 50,000 + 0 Transaction 3: He purchased goods for cash Rs.30,000. As a result, cash balance is reduced by the goods purchased, leaving the total of the assets unchanged. Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash + Furniture + Stock = Capital +Liabilities (Goods) Transaction 1&2   45,000 + 5,000 + 0 = 50,000 + 0 Transaction 3 (-) 30,000 + 0 + 30,000 = 0 + 0 _______________________________________________________________ Equation 15,000 + 5,000 + 30,000 = 50,000 +  0 ___________________________________________________________________ ","36 Transaction 4: He purchased goods on credit for Rs.20,000. The above transaction will increase the value of stock on the assets side and will create a liability in the form of creditors. Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash + Furniture + Stock = Capital +Creditors Transaction 1-3 15,000 + 5,000 + 30,000= 50,000 + 0 Transaction 4 0 + 0 + 20,000= 0 + 20,000 _______________________________________________________________ Equation 15,000 + 5,000 + 50,000 = 50,000 + 20,000 ___________________________________________________________________ Transaction 5: Goods costing Rs.25,000 sold on credit for Rs.35,000. The above transaction will give rise to a new asset in the form of Debtors to the extent of Rs.35,000. But the stock of goods will be reduced by Rs.25,000 i.e., the cost of goods sold. The net increase of Rs.10,000 is the amount of revenue which will be added to the capital. Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash + Furniture + Stock + Debtors = Capital + Creditors + Revenue Transaction 1-4 15,000 + 5,000 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,000 + 20,000 Transaction 5 0 + 0 + (-)25,000 + 35,000 = 10,000 + 0 ___________________________________________________________________ Equation 15,000 + 5,000 + 25,000 + 35,000 = 60,000 + 20,000 ___________________________________________________________________ Transaction 6: Rent paid Rs.3,000. It reduces cash and the rent is an expense, it results in a loss which decreases the capital. Assets = Capital + Liabilities Cash + Furniture + Stock + Debtors = Capital + Creditors Transaction 1-5 15,000 + 5,000 + 25,000 + 35,000 = 60,000 + 20,000 Transaction 6 – 3,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = (-) 3,000 + 0 ________________________________________________________________ Equation 12,000 + 5,000 + 25,000 + 35,000 = 57,000 + 20,000 77,000 = 77,000 ________________________________________________________________ ","37 From the above transactions, it may be concluded that every transaction has a double effect and in each case - Assets = Capital + Liabilities, i.e., ‘Accounting equation is true in all cases’ . The last equation appearing in the books of Mr.Murugan may also be presented in the form of a statement called Balance Sheet. It will appear as below: Balance Sheet of Mr. Murugan as on . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Liabilities Rs. Assets Rs.

Likewise decrease in asset by way of either in increase in another asset or decrease in liability or capital.

Such place is customarily the meaning of debit and credit, it is essential to understand the meaning and form of an account. An account is a record of all business transactions relating to a particular person or asset or liability or expense or income. In accounting, we keep a separate record of each individual, asset, liability, expense or income. The place where such a record is maintained is termed as an ‘Account’. All accounts are divided into two sides. The left hand side of an account is called Debit side and the right hand side of an account is called Credit side. In the abbreviated form Debit is written as Dr. and Credit is written as Cr. For example, the transactions relating to cash are recorded in an account, entitled ‘Cash Account’ and its format will be as given below: Debit (Dr.) Cash Account Credit (Cr.) In order to decide when to write on the debit side of an account and when to write on the credit side of an account, there are two approaches. They are: 1) Accounting Equation Approach, 2) Traditional Approach. Nature of Account The accounting equation is a statement of equality between the debits and the credits. The rules of debit and credit depend on the nature of an account. For this purpose, all the accounts are classified into the following five categories in the accounting equation approach:- 1. Assets Accounts 2. Capital Account 3. Liabilities Accounts 4. Revenues or Incomes Accounts 5. Expenses or Losses Accounts If there is an increase or decrease in one account, there will be equal decrease or increase in another account. Accordingly, the following rules of debit and credit in respect of the various categories of accounts can be obtained. ","41 The rules may be summarised as below :- 1. Increases in assets are debits; decreases in assets are credits. 2. Increases in capital are credits; decreases in capital are debits. 3. Increases in liabilities are credits; decreases in liabilities are debits. 4. Increases in incomes and gains are credits; decreases in incomes and gains are debits. 5. Increases in expenses and losses are debits; decreases in expenses and losses are credits. Elements of Accounting Equation Debit Credit Assets Increase Decrease Liabilities Decrease Increase Capital Decrease Increase Revenues Decrease Increase Expenses Increase Decrease In the traditional approach, all the accounts are classified into the following three types. 1. Personal Accounts 2. Real Accounts 3. Nominal Accounts Golden Rules for Debit and Credit: 1. Personal Accounts – a) Debit the receiver b) Credit the giver 2. Real Accounts – a) Debit what comes in b) Credit what goes out 3. Nominal Accounts – a) Debit all expenses and losses b) Credit all incomes and gains 4.4 Books of Original Entry The books in which a transaction is recorded for the first time from a source document are called Books of Original Entry or Prime Entry. Journal is one of the books of original entry in which transactions are originally recorded in a chronological (day-to-day) order according to the principles of Double Entry System. ","42 4.4.1 Journal Journal is a date-wise record of all the transactions with details of the accounts debited and credited and the amount of each transaction. 4.4.2 Format Journal Date Particulars L.F. Debit Amount Rs. Credit Amount Rs. Explanation: 1. Date : In the first column, the date of the transaction is entered. The year and the month is written only once, till they change. The sequence of the dates and months should be strictly maintained. 2. Particulars : Each transaction affects two accounts, out of which one account is debited and the other account is credited. The name of the account to be debited is written first, very near to the line of particulars column and the word Dr. is also written at the end of the particulars column. In the second line, the name of the account to be credited is written, starts with the word ‘To’ , a few space away from the margin in the particulars column to the make it distinct from the debit account. 3. Narration : After each entry, a brief explanation of the transaction together with necessary details is given in the particulars column with in brackets called narration . The words ‘For’ or ‘Being’ are used before starting to write down narration. Now, it is not necessary to use the word ‘For’ or ‘Being’. 4. Ledger Folio (L.F): All entries from the journal are later posted into the ledger accounts. The page number or folio number of the Ledger, where the posting has been made from the Journal is recorded in the L.F column of the Journal. Till such time, this column remains blank. 5. Debit Amount : In this column, the amount of the account being debited is written. 6. Credit Amount : In this column, the amount of the account being credited is written. ","43 4.4.3 Steps in Journalising The process of analysing the business transactions under the heads of debit and credit and recording them in the Journal is called Journalising. An entry made in the journal is called a ‘Journal Entry’ . Step 1 → Determine the two accounts which are involved in the transaction. Step 2 → Classify the above two accounts under Personal, Real or Nominal. Step 3 → Find out the rules of debit and credit for the above two accounts. Step 4 → Identify which account is to be debited and which account is to be credited. Step 5 → Record the date of transaction in the date column. The year and month is written once, till they change. The sequence of the dates and months should be strictly maintained. Step 6 → Enter the name of the account to be debited in the particulars column very close to the left hand side of the particulars column followed by the abbreviation Dr. in the same line. Against this, the amount to be debited is written in the debit amount column in the same line. Step 7 → Write the name of the account to be credited in the second line starts with the word ‘To’ a few space away from the margin in the particulars column. Against this, the amount to be credited is written in the credit amount column in the same line. Step 8 → Write the narration within brackets in the next line in the particulars column. Step 9 → Draw a line across the entire particulars column to seperate one journal entry from the other. 4.5 Illustrations Example 1: January 1, 2004 – Saravanan started business with Rs. 1,00,000.

","66 CHAPTER - 5 BASIC ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES - III LEDGER Learning Objectives After studying this chapter you will be able to:  understand the Meaning and Procedure for posting.  know the Procedure for Balancing and the Significance of Balances.  know the Relationship between Journal and Ledger. _________________________________________________________________ In the Journal, each transaction is dealt with separately. Therefore, it is not possible to know at a glance, the net result of many transactions. So, in order to ascertain the net effect of all the transactions relating to a particular account are collected at one place in the Ledger. A Ledger is a book which contains all the accounts whether personal, real or nominal, which are first entered in journal or special purpose subsidiary books. According to L.C. Cropper, ‘the book which contains a classified and permanent record of all the transactions of a business is called the Ledger’. The ledger that is normally used in a majority of business concern is a bound note book. This can be preserved for a long time. Its pages are consequently numbered. Each account in the ledger is opened preferably on a separate page. If one page is completed, the account will be continued in the next or some other page. But in bigger concerns, it is not practical to keep the ledger as a bound note book, Loose-leaf ledger now takes the place of a bound note book. In a loose-leaf ledger, appropriate ruled sheets of thick paper are introduced and fixed up with the help of a binder. Whenever necessary additional pages may be inserted, completed accounts can be removed and the accounts may be arranged and rearranged in the desired order. Therefore, this type of ledger is known as Loose-leaf Ledger. 5.1 Utility Ledger is a principal or main book which contains all the accounts in which the transactions recorded in the books of original entry are transferred. Ledger is also called the ‘Book of Final Entry’ or ‘Book of Secondary Entry’ , because the transactions are finally incorporated in the Ledger. The following are the advantages of ledger. ","67 i. Complete information at a glance: All the transactions pertaining to an account are collected at one place in the ledger. By looking at the balance of that account, one can understand the collective effect of all such transactions at a glance. ii. Arithmetical Accuracy With the help of ledger balances, Trial balance can be prepared to know the arithmetical accuracy of accounts. iii. Result of Business Operations It facilitates the preparation of final accounts for ascertaining the operating result and the financial position of the business concern. iv. Accounting information The data supplied by various ledger accounts are summarised, analysed and interpreted for obtaining various accounting information. 5.2 Format Dr. Name of Account Cr. Date Particulars J.F Amount Rs. P. Date Particulars J.F Amount Rs. P. Year Month Date To (Name of Credit Account in Journal) Year Month Date By (Name of Debit account in Journal) Explanation: i. Each ledger account is divided into two parts. The left hand side is known as the debit side and the right hand side is known as the credit side. The words ‘Dr.’ and ‘Cr.’ are used to denote Debit and Credit. ii. The name of the account is mentioned in the top (middle) of the account. iii. The date of the transaction is recorded in the date column. iv. The word ‘To’ is used before the accounts which appear on the debit side of an account in the particulars column. Similarly, the word ‘By’ is used before the accounts which appear on the credit side of an account in the particulars column. ","68 v.

Credit incomes or gains 5.3 Posting The process of transferring the entries recorded in the journal or subsidiary books to the respective accounts opened in the ledger is called Posting . In other words, posting means grouping of all the transactions relating to a particular account at one place. It is necessary to post all the journal entries into various accounts in the ledger because posting helps us to know the net effect of various transactions during a given period on a particular account. ","69 5.3.1 Procedure of posting The procedure of posting is given as follows: I. Procedure of posting for an Account which has been debited in the journal entry. Step 1 → Locate in the ledger, the account to be debited and enter the date of the transaction in the date column on the debit side. Step 2 → Record the name of the account credited in the Journal in the particulars column on the debit side as “To ..... (name of the account credited)”. Step 3 → Record the page number of the Journal in the J.F column on the debit side and in the Journal, write the page number of the ledger on which a particular account appears in the L.F. column. Step 4 → Enter the relevant amount in the amount column on the debit side. II. Procedure of posting for an Account which has been credited in the journal entry. Step 1 → Locate in the ledger the account to be credited and enter the date of the transaction in the date column on the credit side. Step 2 → Record the name of the account debited in the Journal in the particulars column on the credit side as “By ...... (name of the account debited)” Step 3 → Record the page number of the Journal in the J.F column on the credit side and in the Journal, write the page number of the ledger on which a particular account appears in the L.F. column.

Since every debit must have the corresponding equal amount of credit, special care must be taken in posting the compound journal entry, where there may be only one debit aspect but many corresponding credit aspects of equal value or vise versa. The posting of such transactions is done in the same way as already explained. Illustration 3 : Jan. 12, 2003, Cash sales Rs.10,000, Cash received from Kannan Rs.5,000 and commission earned Rs.2,500.

Date Particulars J.F Amount Rs. 2003 Jan 12 By Cash A/c 2,500 Note: In the above transactions, there is only one debit aspect namely cash account and three credit aspects. Therefore, while posting in the cash account, the names of three credit aspects are entered in the cash account on the debit side, thus having a total of Rs.17,500 which is equal to the amount in the debit column of the journal. The cash account is written on the credit side of the three accounts, namely, Sales, Kannan and Commission received, as it acts as an opposite and corresponding accounts for Sales Rs.10,000, Kannan Rs.5,000 and Commission Rs.2,500 respectively which are equal to the amount in the credit column of the journal. 5.3.3 Posting the Opening Entry The opening entry is passed to open the books of accounts for the new financial year. The debit or credit balance of an account what we get at the end of the accounting period is known as closing balance of that account. This closing balance becomes the opening balance in the next accounting year. The procedure of posting an opening entry is same as in the case of an ordinary journal entry. An account which has a debit balance, the words ‘To balance b/d’ are recorded on the debit side in the particulars column. An account which has a credit balance, the words “By balance b/d” are recorded in the particulars column on the credit side. Infact opening entry is not actually posted but the accounts are merely incorporated in the ledger, if the ledger is a new one or old. ","76 Illustration 4 Post the opening entry into the ledger of Rajan as on 1st April 2003, cash in hand Rs. 10,000; Loan Rs. 1,00,000. Solution: In the Books of Rajan Cash Account Dr. Cr.

When posting is done, many accounts may have entries on their debit side as well as credit side. The net result of such debits and credits in an account is the balance. Balancing means the writing of the difference between the amount columns of the two sides in the lighter (smaller total) side, so that the grand totals of the two sides become equal. 5.4.1 Significance of balancing There are three possibilities while balancing an account during a given period. It may be a debit balance or a credit balance or a nil balance depending upon the debit total and the credit total. i. Debit Balance : The excess of debit total over the credit total is called the debit balance . When there is only debit entries in an account, the amount ","77 itself is the balance of that account, i.e., the debit balance. It is first recorded on the credit side, above the total. Then it is entered on the debit side, below the total, as the first item for the next period. Cash Account Dr. Cr. Date Particulars J.F Amount Rs.

Credit Balance : The excess of credit total over the debit total is called the credit balance. When there is only credit entries in an account, the amount itself is the balance of that account i.e., the credit balance. It is first written in the debit side, as the last item, above the total. Then it is recorded on the credit side, below the total, as the first item for the next period. Capital Account Dr. Cr. Date Particulars J.F Amount Rs.

Nil Balance : When the total of debits and credits are equal, it is closed by merely writing the total on both the sides. It indicates the equality of benefits received and given by that account.

Personal Accounts : These accounts are generally balanced regularly to know the amounts due to the persons )creditors( or due from the persons )debtors( . ii. Real Accounts : These accounts are generally balanced at the end of the financial year, when final accounts are being prepared. However, cash account is frequently balanced to know the cash on hand . A debit balance in an asset account indicated the value of the asset owned by the business. Assets accounts always show debit balances. iii. Nominal Accounts : These accounts are in fact, not to be balanced as they are to be closed by transfer to final accounts. A debit balance in a nominal account indicates that it is an expense or loss . A credit balance in a nominal account indicates that it is an income or gain . All such balances in personal and real accounts are shown in the Balance Sheet and the balances in nominal accounts are taken to the Profit and Loss Account. 5.4.3 Procedure for Balancing While balancing an account, the following steps are involved: Step 1 → Total the amount column of the debit side and the credit side separately and then ascertain the difference of both the columns. Step 2 → If the debit side total exceeds the credit side total, put such difference on the amount column of the credit side, write the date on which balancing is being done in the date column and the words “By Balance c/d” ( c/d means carried down) in the particulars column. OR ","79 If the credit side total exceeds the debit side total, put such difference on the amount column of the debit side, write the date on which balancing is being done in the date column and the words “To Balance c/d” in the particulars column. Step 3 → Total again both the amount columns, put the total on both the sides and draw a line above and a line below the totals. Step 4 → Enter the date of the beginning of the next period in the date column and bring down the debit balance on the debit side along with the words “To Balance b/d” ( b/d means brought down) in the particulars column and the credit balance on the credit side along with the words “By balance b/d” in the particulars column. Note: In the place of c/d and b/d , the words c/f or c/o (carried forward or carried over) and b/f or b/o (brought forward or brought over) may also be used. When the balance is carried down in the same page , the words c/d and b/d are used, while balance is carried over to the next page , the term c/o and b/o are used. When balance is carried forward to some other page either in same book or some other book, the abbreviations c/f (carried forward) and b/f (brought forward) are used.

Step 2 → Enter the date of balancing, which is normally the last date of the accounting period (i.e., 31st March 2003) in the date column, “By Balance c/d” in the particulars column, and the difference in the amount column on the credit side. Step 3 → Total both the amount columns and draw a line above and a line below the totals.

Periodical details of some important business transactions cannot be known, from the journal easily, e.g., monthly sales, monthly purchases. ii. Such a system does not facilitate the installation of an internal check system since the journal can be handled by only one person. iii. The journal becomes bulky and voluminous. 6.1 Need Moreover, transactions can be classified and grouped conveniently according to their nature, as some transactions are usually of repetitive in nature. Generally, transactions are of two types: Cash and Credit. Cash transactions can be grouped in one category whereas credit transactions can be grouped in another category. Thus, in practice, the main journal is sub-divided in such a way that a separate book is used for each category or group of transactions which are repetitive and sufficiently large in number. ","90 Each one of the subsidiary books is a special journal and a book of original or prime entry. Though the usual type of journal entries are not passed in these sub-divided journals, the double entry principles of accounting are strictly followed. 6.1.1 Kinds of Subsidiary Books The number of subsidiary books may vary according to the requirements of each business. The following are the special purpose subsidiary books. Transactions Day Books Bills Books Cash Book Journal Proper Purchases Sales Purchases Sales Bills Bills Book Book Return Return Receivable Payable Book Book Book Book 6.1.2 Purpose i. Purchases Book records only credit purchases of goods by the trader. ii. Sales Book is meant for entering only credit sales of goods by the trader. iii. Purchases Return Book records the goods returned by the trader to suppliers. iv. Sales Return Book deals with goods returned (out of previous sales) by the customers. v. Bills Receivable Book records the receipts of bills (Bills Receivable). vi. Bills Payable Book records the issue of bills (Bills Payable). vii. Cash Book is used for recording only cash transactions i.e., receipts and payments of cash. viii. Journal Proper is the journal which records the entries which cannot be entered in any of the above listed subsidiary books. 6.1.3 Advantages The advantages of maintaining subsidiary books can be summarised as under : i. Division of Labour : The division of journal, resulting in division of work, ensures more clerks working independently in recording original entries in the subsidiary books. ","91 ii. Efficiency : The division of labour also helps the reduction in work load, saving in time and stationery. It also gives advantages of specialisation leading to efficiency. iii. Prevents Errors and Frauds : The accounting work can be divided in such a manner that the work of one person is automatically checked by another person. With the use of internal check, the possibility of occurrance of errors and frauds may be avoided. iv. Easy Reference : It facilitates easy references to any particular item. For instance total credit sales for a month can be easily obtained from the Sales Book. v. Easy Postings : Posting from the subsidiary books are made at convenient intervals depending upon the nature of the business. 6.2 Purchases Book Purchases book also known as Bought Day Book is used to record all credit purchases of goods which are meant for resale in the business. Cash purchases of goods, cash and credit purchases of assets are not entered in this book. Before discussing the Purchase Day Book, in detail we are to explain the most significant terms, Trade Discount and Cash Discount. 6.2.1 Trade Discount Trade discount is an allowance or concession granted by the seller to the buyer, if the customer purchases goods above a certain quantity or above a certain amount. The amount of the purchase made, is always arrived at after deducting the trade discount, ie., only the net amount is considered. For example, if the list price (price prescribed by the manufacturers or wholesalers) of a commodity is Rs.100, and trade discount granted by manufacturer to the wholesaler is 20% then cost price of the commodity to the wholesaler is Rs.80. Trade discount is not recorded in the books. They are used for determining the net price. 6.2.2 Cash Discount Sale of goods on credit is a common phenomenon in any business. When goods are sold on credit the customers enjoy a facility of making payment on some date in the future. In order to encourage them to make the payment before the expiry of the credit period a deduction is offered. The deduction so made is known as cash discount. For example, If Ram purchases goods worth Rs.5,000 on 30 days credit then, as per the terms of contract, he is authorised to make payment 30 days after the date of purchase. If he is offered a cash discount of 2% on payment within 10 days and if he does so, he is entitled to deduct Rs.100 from the invoice price and pay Rs.4,900. In this case Rs.100 is cash discount. But if he does not choose to make payment within 10 days then he will not get any cash discount. In this case he will pay Rs.5,000 after 30 days. ","92 6.2.3 Distinction between cash discount and trade discount Trade discount differs from cash discount in the following respects. S.No Basis of Distinction Trade Discount Cash Discount 1. Parties It is a reduction granted by a manufacturer/ supplier It is a reduction granted by a whole- saler (creditor) to the buyer (debtor). 2. Purpose To help the retailer to earn some profit. To encourage prompt payment within a stipulated period. 3. Time when allowed It is allowed on the purchase of goods. It is allowed when payment is made within the specified period. 4. Variation It is usually given at the same rate which is applicable to all customers and will vary with the quantity purchased. It varies from customer to customer depending on the time and period of payment. 5. Disclosure It is shown by way of deduction in the invoice itself. It is not shown in the invoice. 6. Ledger Account A separate Account is not opened in the Ledger. A separate Account is opened in the Ledger for discount received and discount allowed. 6.2.4 Format Purchases Book Date Particulars Inward Invoice No. L.F. Amount Remarks Details Rs. Total Rs.

The procedure for posting is stated as under. Step 1 → Entries will be posted to the credit side of the respective creditors (supplier) account in the ledger by writing “By Purchases A/c” in the particulars column.

The entries in the Purchases Returns Book are usually made on the basis of debit note issued to the suppliers or credit note received from the suppliers. We call it a debit note because the party’s (supplier) account is debited with the amount written in this note. The same note is termed as credit note from the receiving party’s point of view because he will credit the account of the party from whom he has received the note together with goods.

If the amount involved in the credit transaction is large, the seller needs security and evidence over the dealings. Here the Bill of Exchange solves the problems of the seller. 6.5.1 Definition According to the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, ‘ Bill of Exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument’. An analysis of the definition given above highlights the following important features of a bill of exchange. i. It is a written document. ii. It is an unconditional order. iii. It is an order to pay a certain sum of money. ","104 iv. It is signed by the drawer. v. It bears stamp or it is drafted on a stamp paper. vi. It is accepted by the acceptor. vii. The amount is paid to drawer or endorsee. 6.5.2 Format Bill of Exchange 328, Bazaar Street, Stamp Trichy - 4, 01.06.2003 Rs. 10,000/- Three months after date pay to me or to my order the sum of Rupees Ten Thousand only for value received. To Damodaran Thiru.Sundaram, 430, Mint Street, Chennai - 1. Accepted Sundaram 4/6/2003 6.5.3 Important terms Explanation of some terms connected with bill of exchange is given below. 1. Drawing of a Bill The seller (creditor) prepares the bill in the form presented above. The act of preparing the bill in its complete form with the signature is known as ‘drawing’ a bill. 2. Parties There are three parties to a bill of exchange as under. i. Drawer: The person who prepares the bill is called the drawer i.e., a creditor. ii. Drawee: The person who has to make the payment or who accepts to make the payment is called the drawee i.e., a debtor. iii. Payee: The person who receives the payment is payee. He may be a third party or the drawer himself. In the above format drawer and payee is Damodaran. Sundaram is the drawee. ","105 3. Acceptance In a bill drawee gives his acceptance by writing the word ‘accepted’ and also puts his signature and the date. Now the bill becomes a legal document enforceable in the court of law. 4. Due date and Days of grace When a bill is drawn payable after a specified period the date on which the payment should be made is called ‘Due Date’. In the calculation of the due date three extra days are added to the specified period of the bill are known as ‘Days of Grace’ . If the date of maturity falls on a holiday, the bill will be due for payment on the preceeding day. Example : Date of Bill Period of Bill Days of Grace Due date 1st March 2 month 3 4th May 12th July 1 month 3 14th Aug. since 15th Aug. (being independence day) is a public holiday. 1st Oct. 30 days 3 3rd November 5. Endorsement Endorsement means writing of one’s signature on the face or back of a bill for the purpose of transferring the title of the bill to another person. The person who endorses is called the “Endorser”. The person to whom a bill is endorsed is called the “Endorsee” . The endorsee is entitled to collect the money. 6. Discounting When the holder of a bill is in need of money before the due date of a bill he can convert it into cash by discounting the bill with his banker. This process is referred to as discounting of bill. The banker deducts a small amount of the bill which is called discount and pay the balance in cash immediately to the holder of the bill. 7. Retiring of Bill An acceptor may make the payment of a bill before its due date and discharge his liability, it is called as retirement of a bill . Usually the holder of the bill allows a concession called rebate to the drawee for the unexpired period of the bill. ","106 8. Renewal When the acceptor of a bill knows in advance that he will not be able to meet the bill on its due date, he may approach the drawer with a request for extension of time for payment. The drawer of the bill may agree to cancel the original bill and draw a new bill for the amount due with interest thereon. This is referred to as renewal . 9. Dishonour Dishonour of the bill means the non-payment of bill, when it is presented for payment. 10. Noting and Protesting If a bill is dishonoured, the drawer may approach the court, and file a suit against the drawee. In order to collect documentary evidence, the drawer may approach a lawyer and explain the fact of the dishonour of the bill. The lawyer will take the bill to the drawee and ask for the payment. If the drawee does not make the payment, the lawyer will note the statement of the drawee and get the statement signed by him. The lawyer will then put his signature. The statement noted by the lawyer will be the documentary evidence for the dishonour of the bill. Writing this statement by the lawyer is known as noting of the bill. The lawyer performing this work of noting the bill is called as the ‘Notary Public’ . A notary public is an official appointed by the Government. After recording a note of dishonour on the dishonoured bill, the Notary Public issues a certificate to this effect which is called protest . A protest is a certificate issued by the Notary Public attesting that the bill has been dishonoured. 6.6 Bills Books When the number of bills received or issued is large journalising of all bill transactions will result in enormous waste of time. Hence, suitable registers like bills receivable book and bills payable book are maintained to record the receipt of bills receivable and issue of bills payable respectively. These books are also called Bills Journals / Books. 6.6.1 Bills Receivable Book Bills receivable )B/R( book is used for the purpose of recording the details of bills receivable. The individual accounts of parties from whom bills are received will be credited with the amount in the bills receivable book. The periodic total is posted to the debit of bills receivable account in the ledger by writing “To sundries as per Bills Receivable Book”. ","107 6.6.2 Bills Payable Book Bills payable )B/P( book is used for the purpose of recording the details of bills payable. The individual accounts of the parties to whom the bills are issued will be debited with the corresponding amount in the bills payable book. The periodic total is posted to the credit of bills payable account in the ledger by writing “By Sundries as per Bills Payable Book”. 6.7 Journal Proper Journal proper is used for making the original record of such transactions for which no special journal has been kept in the business.

The cash book is a book of original entry or prime entry since transactions are recorded for the first time from the source documents. The cash book is a ledger in the sense that it is designed in the form of a cash account and records cash receipts on the debit side and cash payments on the credit side. Thus, the cash book is both a journal and a ledger. Cash Book will always show debit balance, as cash payments can never exceed cash available. In short, cash book is a special journal which is used for recording all cash receipts and cash payments. 7.2 Advantages 1.

Cash Book with Cash and Bank Columns When bank transactions are more in number, it is advisable to open a cash book by providing a separate column on either side of the cash book to record the bank transactions therein. In such case, it is not necessary to open a separate Bank Account in the Ledger because the two columns in the cash book serve the purpose of Cash Account and Bank Account respectively. It is a combination of Cash Account and Bank Account. The format of this cash book is given below. Double Column Cash Book Debit Side (Cash book with Cash and Bank Columns) Credit Side Date Particulars R. N. L. F. Cash Rs, Bank Rs, Date Particulars V. N. L. F. Cash Rs, Bank Rs, There are two amount columns on debit side one for cash receipts and the other for bank deposits (i.e., payment made into Bank Account).

Contra Entry When an entry affect both cash and bank accounts it is called a contra entry. Contra in Latin means opposite. In contra entries both the debit and credit aspects of a transaction are recorded in the cash book itself. Example 1: Cash paid into bank Bank A/c Dr. x x x To Cash A/c x x x (Cash paid into bank) This is a contra entry. As the cash book with cash and bank columns is a combined cash and bank account, both the aspects of the transaction will be entered in the same book. In the debit side ‘To Cash A/c’ will be entered in the particulars column and the amount will be entered in the bank column. In the ","122 credit side ‘By Bank A/c’ will be entered in the particulars column and the amount will be entered in the cash column. Such contra entries are denoted by writing the letter ‘C’ in the L.F. column, on both sides of the cash book. They indicate that no posting in respect thereof is necessary in the ledger. Example 2: Cash withdrawn from bank for office use. Cash A/c Dr. x x x To Bank A/c x x x (Cash withdrawn for office use) This is also a contra entry.

(Answer : Cash balance Rs.7,300; Bank balance (cr) Rs.8,400) ","145 CHAPTER - 8 SUBSIDIARY BOOKS III - PETTY CASH BOOK Learning Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to:  understand the Meaning and Uses of Petty Cash Book.  know the Procedure for Recording in Petty Cash Book. _________________________________________________________________ In every business, of whatever size, there are many small cash payments such as conveyance, carriage, postage, telegram, etc. These expenses are generally repetitive in nature. If all these small payments are recorded in the cash book, it will be difficult for the cashier to maintain the records all by himself. In order to make the task of the cashier easy, these small and recurring expenses are recorded in a separate cash book called “Petty Cash Book” and the person who maintains the petty cash is called the “Petty Cashier” . Petty means ‘small’. The petty cash book is a book where small recurring payments like carriage, cartage, postage and telegram, printing and stationery etc., are recorded by the petty cashier, a person other than the main cashier. 8.1 Imprest System Imprest means ‘money advanced on loan’. Under this system the amount required to meet out various petty expenses is estimated and given to the petty cashier at the beginning of the specified period, usually a month. All the payments are supported by vouchers. At the end of the given period or earlier, when the petty cashier has spent the petty cash amount, he closes the petty cash book for the period and balances it. Then he submits the accounts to the cashier. He verifies the petty cash book with the vouchers. After satisfying himself as to the correctness and genuiness of the payments an amount equal to the cash spent is given to the petty cashier. This amount together with the unspent amount will bring up the cash in hand to the amount with which he originally started i.e., the imprest amount . Thus the system of reimbursing the amount spent by the petty cashier at fixed period, is known as the imprest system of petty cash. ","146 For example, On June 1, 2002, Rs.1,000 was given to the petty cashier. He had spent Rs.940 during the month. He will be paid Rs.940 on 30th June by the cashier so that he may again have Rs.1,000 for the next month i.e., July. 8.2 Analytical Petty Cash Book As in the case of any other cash book, petty cash book also has the debit side and the credit side. The debit side is smaller and has very infrequent entries because cash receipt by the petty cashier is mainly from the cashier at the beginning or close of a specified period. The credit side is bigger and thus has many columns. For each important petty expenses there is a seperate column, and therefore columnar cash book is another name for this petty cash book. These analytical columns helps to know the actual amount spent on each and every type of petty expenses for the specified period. Each petty payment is first entered in the total payments column, and then recorded in the respective analytical column, so that : i. the total amount spent on each expenses for a particular period can be easily ascertained by adding up the respective column. ii. only the periodical total of each column is posted to the ledger. iii. the total petty payment for any period can be easily ascertained from the total payments column. The analytical petty cash book may be designed according to the requirements of the business. 8.3 Format The format is given in the next page. Explanation of columns in the analytical petty cash book 1. Receipts: This is the first column of the petty cash book. Amount received by the petty cashier for meeting petty expenses and the opening balance of petty cash will be recorded in this column. 2. C.B.F.N: This refers to Cash Book Folio Number. In this column we write the page number of the cash book where cash paid by the cashier is recorded. 3. Date: In this column, the date of receipt / payment of cash is recorded. 4. Particulars: This column records the details of the receipts / payments. Cash received in the beginning is shown as ‘To cash’ and all the petty expenses are shown as ‘By expenses’ (name of the expense). ","147 Analytical Petty Cash Book of ....................... Dr. Cr.

On the debit side of the cash book, the bank column represents: 1. Cheques deposited into bank for collection. 2. Cash paid into bank and 3. Some entries that are made only after receiving the information from the bank viz., i. Amounts collected by the bank on our behalf as per the standing instructions, for example, Interest collected on investment. ii. Interest given by the banker for the balance kept by us in our bank account. iii. The amount paid by our customers directly into our bank account. On the other hand, on the credit side of the cash book, represents: 1. Cheques issued for payment. 2. Cash withdrawn from bank for office use and personal use. 3. In addition, some entries are made after receiving information from the bank viz., i. Amounts paid by the bank on our behalf as per the standing instructions, for example, payment of insurance premium. ","163 ii. Interest charged by the bank for the amount drawn over and above the actual balance kept in the bank account. iii. Bank charges payable for the agency and utility services rendered by the bank. 9.1 Bank Pass Book Bank Pass Book (statement of account) is merely a copy of the customer’s account in the books of a bank. It shows all the deposits, withdrawals and the balance available in the customers account. 9.1.1 Format Bank Pass Book Date Particulars Dr. Withdrawals Rs. Cr. Deposits Rs. Balance Dr / Cr Rs. Initials In the date column, the dates of the transactions are recorded. In the particulars column withdrawals and deposits are recorded. The balance after each transaction is recorded in the next column and the bank official signs in the last column. Following the principles of Double Entry, banker credits the account of the customer for all the amounts received from the customer and on his behalf. Similarly the banker debits the account of the customer for all withdrawals and amounts paid to others on behalf of the customers. The main point to be remembered is that entries are made only after cash is received or paid, except in the case of interest and bank charges. Interest and bank charges are mere book adjustments and in these ,there are neither receipt of cash nor payment of cash. 9.2 Difference between Cash Book and Pass Book S.No Basis of Distinction Cash Book )Bank Column( Pass Book 1. Maintained by Cashier Banker 2. Deposits of Cash Entered on the debit side of the cash book. Entered on the credit column of the pass book. ","164 3. Withdrawals of Cash Entered on the credit side of the cash book. Entered on the debit column of the pass book. 4. Cheques deposited for collection Entered on the debit side of the cash book on the date of depositing the cheques into the bank. Entered in the pass book only on the date of the realisation of the cheque. 5. Cheques issued Entered on the credit side of the cash book on the date of issuing the cheque to the creditors. Entered on the debit column of the pass book only on the date on which they are presented and paid. 6. Collections and payments as per customers standing instructions Entered in the Cash book after seeing the pass book. Entered in the Pass book first. 7. Signature It is not signed by the cashier It is signed by the Bank official after each transaction. 8. Balancing It is balanced at the end of a specified period. It is balanced after each transaction 9.3 Bank Reconciliation Statement The balance of the bank column in the double or triple column cash book represents the customers cash balance at bank. It should be the same as shown by his bank pass book on any particular day. For every entry made in the cash book if there is a corresponding entry in the pass book(maintained by the banker) or vice versa, the bank balance will be the same in both the books. However, it must be noted that the cash book and the pass book are maintained by two different parties and hence it is not certain that entry in one book will always have a corresponding entry in the other. Normally entries in the cash book should tally (agree) with those in the pass book and the balances shown by both the books should be the same. But in practice, the balances generally differ. In case of disagreement in the balance of the cash book and the pass book, the need for preparing Bank Reconciliation Statement arises. ","165 9.3.1 Definition ‘ Bank reconciliation statement is a list in which the various items that cause a difference between bank balance as per cash book and pass book on any given date are indicated’. 9.3.2 Need and Importance After tracing the various items of difference, a bank reconciliation statement is prepared. The following are its advantages in which lies its importance. i. The errors that might have taken place in the cash book in connection with bank transactions can be easily found. ii. Regular preparation of bank reconciliation statement prevents frauds. iii. It indirectly imposes moral check on the accounting staff. iv. By the preparation of bank reconciliation statement, uncredited cheque can be detected and steps can be taken for their collection. 9.4 Causes of disagreement between the balance shown by the cash book and the balance shown by the pass book 1. Cheques paid into bank but not yet collected The cheques paid into bank for collection but not credited into the account of the customer, because the cheque is i. not collected and credited till that date. ii. collected but the bank staff has forgotten to make entry. iii. collected but credited to wrong account. iv. dishonoured. v. collected for No.I account but credited to No.II account of the same customer. As soon as the cheques are sent to the bank, entries are made in the debit side of the cash book (bank column). But, usually bank credit the customers account only when they have received payment from the bank concerned, in other words, when the cheques have been collected. Hence, there will be a time gap between the depositing of the cheques and the collection by the bank. For example, Bharat Company Limited deposited a cheque on March 28, 2003 for a sum of Rs.3,000. The cheque was collected on April 4, 2003. In case the bank sends a statement of account upto March 31, 2003, there will be a difference of Rs 3,000 between the balance shown by the cash book and the pass book. ","166 2. Cheques issued but not yet presented for payment The cheques issued but not debited customers account may be because the cheque is i. not cashed till date. ii. not presented till date. iii. presented but dishonoured for some reasons or other. iv. lost by the party to whom the cheque was issued. v. cashed out of No.I account but wrongly debited to No.II account of the same customer. In all of the above cases, the entry in the cash book is made immediately on the issue of cheque but naturally the entry will be made by bank only when the cheque is presented for payment. Thus there will be a gap of some days between the entry for issue of cheque in the cash book and the entry for payment made in the pass book. For example, Bharat Company Limited issued a cheque in favour of Mr.Krishna on March 28, 2003 for a sum of Rs.5,000. The cheque is presented for payment at the bank on April 4, 2003. In case, bank sends a statement of account upto March 31, 2003, there will be a difference of Rs.5,000 between the balance as shown by the cash book and the balance as shown by the pass book. 3. Amount credited by the banker in the pass book without the immediate knowledge of the customer The following are some of the examples for the above statement i. The bank might have collected rent, dividend, bills of exchange, interest etc., due for the customer as per standing instructions . ii. Some debtors might have directly paid into bank. iii. Bank credits interest on the credit balance of the customer’s account. iv. The banker has wrongly credited this account instead of some other account. In all the above cases, the entry will be first entered in the pass book. The customer will know this only after he verifies the entries in the pass book. So there may be a time gap of some days before the customer includes entries made in the pass book. For example, the bank has credited Bharat Company Limited’s account for interest amounting to Rs.500 on March 31, 2003. The bank prepares and sends a ","167 statement of account on March 31, 2003. If the customer receives the statement of account on April 4, 2003, there will be a difference of Rs 500 bewteen the balance shown by the cash book and the balance shown by the pass book. 4. Amounts debited by the banker in the pass book without the immediate knowledge of the customer The following are some of the examples for this. i. The banker has recorded bank charges, interest on overdraft etc. ii. The banker has paid insurance premium, subscription for periodicals, etc. on behalf of the customer as per the standing instructions. iii. The banker has wrongly debited this account instead of some other account. iv. The banker has paid the bills payable of the customer as per standing instructions . v. Dishonour of a cheque deposited and discounted bills receivable. In all the above cases, the entry will be first entered in the pass book of the customer. And the customer will know only after he verifies the entries in the pass book or statement of account . So there may be a time gap of some days before the customer includes the entries made in the pass book. For example, the bank has debited Bharat Company Limited’s account for its charges amounting to Rs. 250 on March 31,2003. In case, the bank sends a statement of account upto March 31,2003, there will be a difference of Rs.250 between the balance as per the cash book and the balance as per the pass book. For example, A cheque for Rs.5,000 dishonoured on March 28, 2003. In case, the bank sends a statement of account upto March 31, 2003 there will be a difference of Rs.5,000 between the balance as shown by the cash book and the balance as shown by the pass book. After tracing the various items of differences, a Bank reconciliation statement is prepared by starting with the balance shown by any of the two books. But in actual practice, a Bank reconciliation statement is prepared by the customer starting with the balance as per cash book and will ensure that the balance as per pass book is arrived at. Bank Overdraft Bank overdraft is an amount drawn over and above the actual balance kept in the bank account. This facility is available only to the current account holders. Interest will be charged for the amount overdrawn i.e., overdraft. The Cash book will show a credit balance i.e., unfavourable balance. The pass book will show a debit balance.

","184 CHAPTER - 10 TRIAL BALANCE AND RECTIFICATION OF ERRORS Learning Objectives After learning this chapter you will be able to:  know the Meaning, Objectives and Preparation of Trial Balance.  identify the Kinds of Errors.  understand the Procedure for Rectification of Errors. _________________________________________________________________ In the previous chapters, you have learnt how to record and classify the transactions in the various accounts along with balancing thereof. The next step in the accounting process is to prepare a statement to check the arithmetical accuracy of the transactions recorded so for. This statement is called ‘Trial Balance’ . Trial balance is a statement which shows debit balances and credit balances of all accounts in the ledger. Since, every debit should have a corresponding credit as per the rules of double entry system, the total of the debit balances and credit balances should tally (agree). In case, there is a difference, one has to check the correctness of the balances brought forward from the respective accounts. Trial balance can be prepared in any date provided accounts are balanced. 10.1 Definition “Trial balance is a statement, prepared with the debit and credit balances of ledger accounts to test the arithmetical accuracy of the books” – J.R. Batliboi. 10.2 Objectives The objectives of preparing a trial balance are: i. To check the arithmetical accuracy of the ledger accounts. ii. To locate the errors. iii. To facilitate the preparation of final accounts. ","185 10.3 Advantages The advantages of the trial balance are i. It helps to ascertain the arithmetical accuracy of the book-keeping work done during the period. ii. It supplies in one place ready reference of all the balances of the ledger accounts. iii. If any error is found out by preparing a trial balance, the same can be rectified before preparing final accounts. iv. It is the basis on which final accounts are prepared. 10.4 Methods A trial balance can be prepared in the following methods. i. The Total Method : According to this method, the total amount of the debit side of the ledger accounts and the total amount of the credit side of the ledger accounts are recorded. ii. The Balance Method : In this method, only the balances of an account either debit or credit, as the case may be, are recorded against their respective accounts. The balance method is more widely used, as it supplies ready figures for preparing the final accounts. 10.5 Format Trial Balance of ABC Ltd. as on .................. Sl.No Name of Account L.F Debit Rs. Credit Rs. ","186 Points to be noted : i. Date on which trial balance is prepared should be mentioned at the top. ii. Name of Account column contains the list of all ledger accounts. iii. Ledger folio of the respective account is entered in the next column. iv. In the debit column, debit balance of the respective account is entered. v. Credit balance of the respective account is written in the credit column. vi. The last two columns are totalled at the end. 10.6 Sundry Debtors and Sundry Creditors In the ledger there are many personal accounts, some of them may show debit balances, some others may show credit balances. If all the names are to be written in the trial balance it will be unduly long. Therefore, a list of names with the debit balances is prepared. This list is known as ‘Sundry Debtors’ (Sundry means ‘many’). Similarly, a list of names with the credit balances is prepared. This list is known as ‘Sundry Creditors’ .

It is included here to illustrate the following generalised rules, that i) a debit balance is either an asset or loss or expense; and ii) a credit balance is either a liability or income or gain. 10.7 Limitations Though the trial balance helps to ensure the arithmetical accuracy of the books of accounts, it is possible only when the accountant has not committed any error. As all the errors made are not disclosed by the trial balance, it would not be regarded as a conclusive proof of correctness of the books of accounts maintained. ","188 10.8 Errors in Accounting The fundamental principle of the double-entry system is that every debit has a corresponding credit of equal amount and vice-versa. Therefore, the total of all debit balances in different accounts must be equal to the total of all credit balances in different accounts, i.e., the total of the two columns should tally (agree). The tallying of the two totals (debit balances and credit balances) of the trial balance ensures only arithmetic accuracy but not accounting accuracy. If however, the two totals do not tally, it implies that some errors have been committed while recording the transactions in the books of accounts. The following are the various kinds of errors. 10.8.1. Kinds of Errors Keeping in view the nature of errors, all the errors committed in the accounting process can be classified into two. i. Errors of Principle and ii. Clerical Errors Kinds of Errors Errors Errors of Principle Clerical Errors Errors of Errors of Compensating Omission Commission Errors i. Partial omission i. Error of recording ii. Complete omission ii. Error of posting iii. Error of casting iv. Error of carrying forward I. Errors of Principle Transactions are recorded as per generally accepted accounting principles. If any of these principles is violated or ignored, errors resulting from such violation are known as errors of principle . For example, Purchase of assets recorded in the purchases book. It is an error of principle, because the purchases book is meant for recording credit purchases of goods meant for resale and not fixed assets. A trial balance will not disclose errors of principle. ","189 II. Clerical Errors These errors arise because of mistakes committed in the ordinary course of accounting work. These can be further classified into three types as follows. a) Errors of Omission This error arises when a transaction is completely or partially omitted to be recorded in the books of accounts. Errors of omission may be classified as below. i. Error of Complete Omission: This error arises when a transaction is totally omitted to be recorded in the books of accounts. For example, Goods purchased from Ram completely omitted to be recorded. This error does not affect the trial balance. ii. Error of Partial Omission: This error arises when only one aspect of the transaction either debit or credit is recorded. For example, a credit sale of goods to Siva recorded in sales book but omitted to be posted in Siva’s account. This error affects the trial balance. b( Errors of Commission This error arises due to wrong recording, wrong posting, wrong casting, wrong balancing, wrong carrying forward etc. Errors of commission may be classified as follows: i. Error of Recording: This error arises when a transaction is wrongly recorded in the books of original entry. For example, Goods of Rs.5,000, purchased on credit from Viji, is recorded in the book for Rs.5,500. This error does not affect the trial balance. ii. Error of Posting: This error arises when information recorded in the books of original entry are wrongly entered in the ledger. Error of posting may be i. Right amount in the right side of wrong account. ii. Right amount in the wrong side of correct account iii. Wrong amount in the right side of correct account iv. Wrong amount in the wrong side of correct account v. Wrong amount in the wrong side of wrong account vi. Wrong amount in the right side of wrong account, etc. This error may or may not affect the trial balance. ","190 iii. Error of Casting (Totalling) : This error arises when a mistake is committed while totalling the subsidiary book. For example, instead of Rs.12,000 it may be wrongly totalled as Rs.13,000. This is called overcasting . If it is wrongly totalled as Rs.11,000, it is called undercasting . iv. Error of Carrying Forward : This error arises when a mistake is committed in carrying forward a total of one page to the next page. For example, Total of purchase book in page 282 of the ledger Rs.10,686, while carrying forward the balance to the next page it was recorded as Rs.10,866. c( Compensating Errors The errors arising from excess debits or under debits of accounts being neutralised by the excess credits or under credits to the same extent of some other account is compensating error. Since the errors in one direction are compensated by errors in another direction, arithmetical accuracy of the trial balance is not at all affected inspite of such errors. For example, If the purchases book and sales book are both overcast (excess totalling) by Rs.10,000, the errors mutually compensate each other. This error will not affect the agreement of trial balance. 10.8.2 Errors disclosed and not disclosed by trial balance If the impact of the errors on trial balance is considered, errors may be classified into two categories – Errors disclosed by trial balance, and Errors not disclosed by trial balance. ERRORS Errors disclosed by Errors not disclosed by Trial Balance Trial Balance 1. Errors of partial omission 1. Errors of complete omission 2. Errors of casting 2. Errors of recording 3. Errors of carrying forward 3. Errors of principle 4. Errors of posting in the wrong 4. Errors of posting to wrong side of the correct account account in the right side with the correct amount 5. Errors of posting to correct 5. Compensating Errors account with wrong amount 6. Double posting in the same account I llustration 2 State the type of error involved in the following transactions and say whether it will affect the agreement of the trial balance or not. 1. The sales book is undercast by Rs. 2,000. 2. The purchases book is overcast by Rs. 1,500. ","191 3. The purchases return book is overcast by Rs.5,000. 4. The sales return book is overcast by Rs.1,000. 5. Goods returned by Vani worth Rs.1,500 were not entered. 6. Goods returned by Venu & Co. Rs.4,000 were not posted. 7. Goods sold to Robin for Rs. 2,600 has been debited to Robert’s A/c. 8. A credit sale to Basha for Rs. 3,500 was entered as Rs.5300. 9. A purchase of Machinery for Rs.50,000 has been entered in the purchases book. 10. A credit purchase from Senthil for Rs. 6,250 was debited to Santhosh’s A/c. from purchases book. 11. Cash received for commission Rs.2,735 was posted to the commission account as Rs. 2,375. 12. The monthly total of discount column on the debit side of the cash book Rs. 1,350 was credited to discount allowed account. 13. Cash paid for insurance Rs. 6,310 was posted to the insurance A/c. as Rs. 6,130. 14. The monthly total of discount column on the credit side of the cash book Rs. 22,500 was debited to discount received account. 15. A sale to Kaveri Rs. 6,900 has been entered in the purchases book. Solution: 1. This is an error of casting and it affect sales account only. The trial balance will not tally. 2. This is an error of casting and it affect purchases account only. The trial balance will not agree. 3. This is an error of casting and it affect purchases return account only. The trial balance will not agree. 4. This is an error of casting and it affect sales return account only. The trial balance will not agree. 5. This is an error of complete omission. Since both the aspects have been omitted, this error will not affect the agreement of the trial balance. 6. This is an error of partial omission. Since the principles of double entry is not completed, this error will affect the agreement of the trial balance. ","192 7. This is an error of posting i.e., right amount in the right side of the wrong account. This error will not affect the agreement of the trial balance. 8. This is an error of recording i.e., wrong entry in the subsidiary book. Since the mistake is found in both debit and credit aspects to the same extent. The agreement of the trial balance will not be affected. 9. This is an error of principle. This error will not affect the agreement of the trial balance. 10. This is an error of recording i.e., wrong entry in the subsidiary book. Since, the mistake is found in both debit and credit aspects to the same extent. The agreement of the trial balance will not affected. 11. This is an error of posting involving posting of wrong amount. Since the commission account has an excess credit of Rs.360, the trial balance will be affected. 12. This is an error of posting involving posting on the wrong side of an account. The amount must have been debited to discount allowed account. The trial balance will not agree to the extent of Rs.2,700 i.e., twice the amount of the transaction. 13. This is an error of posting involving posting of wrong amount. Since the insurance account has a short debit of Rs.180, the trial balance will be affected. 14. This is an error of posting involving posting on the wrong side of an account. The amount must have been credited to discount received account. The trial balance will not agree to the extent of Rs.45,000, ie., twice the amount of the transaction. 15. This is an error of recording. In this transaction, error is made in the book of original entry, the trial balance will not be affected. An entry has been made wrongly in the purchases book instead of the sales book. To rectify this, Kaveri A/c is to be debited with Rs.13,800 and Purchases A/c. and Sales A/c. are to be credited with Rs.6,900 each. 10.9 Steps to Locate the Errors: If the trial balance does not tally, it means there are some errors in the books of accounts. The various steps which may be taken to locate the errors include the following: Step 1 → Check the total of the trial balance and ascertain the exact amount of difference in the trial balance. ","193 Step 2 → The difference is halved to find out whether there is any balance of the same amount in the trial balance. It is because, such a balance might have been recorded on the wrong side of the trial balance and hence, the difference is double the amount. Step 3 → If the second step fails to locate the error, the difference in the trial balance is divided by 9. If it is divisible by 9 without any remainder, the error is due to transposition of figures. For example, transposition of figures represents writing of Rs.780 for Rs.870. Step 4 → See whether the balance of all ledger accounts including cash and bank balances are included in the trial balance. Step 5 → Ensure that all the opening balances have been correctly brought forward in the current year’s books. Step 6 → If the difference in the trial balance is of large amount, the trial balance of the current year is compared with that of the previous year and an account showing a large difference over the figure in the previous year’s trial balance should be rechecked. Step 7 → If the error is not detected by the above steps, care should be taken to scrutinise the i. totals of all the subsidiary books. ii. posting made from the journal and the subsidiary books to the relevant ledger accounts. iii. balances extracted from the various ledger accounts. iv. totalling of the ledger balances. Even after following the above steps, if the error could not be located, the whole of the prime entry must once again be checked and in case of need, the posting to the ledger should be rechecked thoroughly. 10.10 Suspense Account When it is difficult to locate the mistakes before preparing the final accounts, the difference in the trial balance is transferred to newly opened imaginary and temporary account called ‘Suspense Account’ . Suspense account is prepared to avoid the delay in the preparation of final accounts. If the total debit balances of the trial balance exceeds the total credit balances, the difference is transferred to the credit side of the suspense account. On the other hand, if the total credit balances of the trial balance exceeds the total debit balances the difference is transferred to the debit side of the suspense account. ","194 When the errors affecting the suspense account are located, they are rectified with suspense account. Suspense account is continued in the books until the errors are located and rectified. Such balance will be shown in the balance sheet. Debit balance will be shown on the asset side and the credit balance will be shown on the liability side. When all the errors affecting the trial balance are located and rectified, the suspense account automatically gets closed. The following illustration will help to understand the suspense account : Illustration 3 The following balances were extracted from the ledger of Mr.Ramakrishna as on 31st March 2003.

Correcting the errors that has occured is called Rectification . Appropriate entry is passed or suitable explanatory note is written in the respective account or accounts to neutralise the effect of errors. From the point of rectification, errors may be classified as follows: i. Single sided errors are errors which affect one side of an account. ii. Double sided errors are errors which affect both the accounts in a transaction. Basic Principles for Rectification of Errors All errors, whatever may be their kind or nature, result in one of the following four positions in one or more accounts. i. Excess debit in one or more accounts: This must be rectified by ‘crediting’ the excess amount to the respective account or accounts. ","196 ii. Short debit in one or more accounts: This must be rectified by a ‘further debit’ to the respective account or accounts involved. iii. Excess credit in one or more accounts: This can be rectified by ‘debiting’ the respective account with the excess amount involved. iv. Short credit in one or more accounts: This can be rectified by a ‘further credit’ to the respective account or accounts involved. The following three steps may be adopted while attempting to rectify an error: i. Ascertain what has actually been done, i.e. what is the error? . ii. Make sure what ought to have been done, i.e., the correct record . iii. Decide what is to be done in view of what has been done and what ought to have been done. i.e., rectification . Stages of Rectification The stage in which rectification is done depends on identification or locating the error. Rectification of errors may be explained in two stages. i. Rectification before the preparation of trial balance : In this stage errors are located before transferring the difference in the trial balance to Suspense Account. ii. Rectification after the preparation of trial balance: In this stage the difference in the trial balance would have been transferred to Suspense Account. So wherever applicable suspense account is used while passing rectification entries. Stage at which the errors are rectified Manner in which the errors are rectified i. When the errors are rectified before transferring the difference in the trial balance to the suspense account By debiting or crediting the respective account with the required amount by giving an explanatory note in the particulars column. ii.When the errors are rectified after transferring the difference in the trial balance to the suspense account By writing a journal entry with the respective account or accounts affected by the errors and suspense account.

Sales to Khader for Rs.780 has been posted to his account as Rs.870. ","199 Solution: i. Purchases from Bagavathi should have been posted to the credit of Bagavathi’s A/c., but it has been debited. Hence, Credit Bagavathi’s A/c with double the amount i.e, Rs.9,000. ii. Sales to Vijay has to be debited in Vijay’s account but his account is credited with Rs.1,250. Hence, Debit Vijay’s A/c with Rs.1,250 + Rs.1,520 i.e, Rs.2,770. iii. This is an error of omission. Posting must be to the credit of Shakila’s A/c. Hence, post Rs.750 to the credit of Shakila’s A/c. iv. Here Khader’s A/c has been debited with a wrong amount i.e., with excess amount. To rectify this error, the excess amount must be credited to his account. Hence, credit Khader’s A/c with Rs.90. I llustration 7 The following errors were found in the books of Prabhu.

","212 CHAPTER - 11 CAPITAL AND REVENUE TRANSACTIONS Learning Objectives After studying this chapter, you will be able to:  identify Capital, Revenue and Deferred Revenue Expenditures.  understand Capital and Revenue receipts _________________________________________________________________ Once the trial balance is prepared the next step is to find out the net result (profit or loss account) and financial position (balance sheet) of the business concern. The business concern’s financial position is bound to be affected by the result of its operations. ‘Matching Principle’ governs the preparation of these two statements. According to this principle the revenues and relevant expenditures incurred during a particular period should be matched. Thus a proper distinction must be accounted for between capital and revenue transactions. Business transactions can be capital transactions or revenue transactions. 11.1 Capital Transactions The business transactions, which provide benefits or supply services to the business concern for more than one year or one operating cycle of the business, are known as capital transactions.

In other words, asset includes possessions and properties of the business. Asset are classified as follows: Assets Tangible Intangible Fictitious Fixed Current ","237 a( Tangible Assets: Assets which have some physical existence are known as tangible assets. They can be seen, touched and felt, e.g. Plant and Machinery Tangible assets are classified into i. Fixed assets : Assets which are permanent in nature having long period of life and cannot be converted into cash in a short period are termed as fixed assets . ii. Current assets : Assets which can be converted into cash in the ordinary course of business and are held for a short period is known as current assets . This is also termed as floating assets . For example, cash in hand, cash at bank, sundry debtors etc b( Intangible Assets The assets which have no physical existence and cannot be seen or felt. They help to generate revenue in future, e.g. goodwill, patents, trademarks etc. c( Fictitious Assets These assets are nothing but the unwritten off losses or non-recoupable expenses. They are really not assets but are worthless items. For example, Preliminary expenses. Liabilities The amount which a business owes to others is liabilities. Credit balance of personal and real accounts together with the capital account are liabilities. Liabilities Long Term Current Contigent a( Long Term Liabilities Liabilities which are repayable after a long period of time are known as Long Term Liabilities. For example, capital, long term loans etc. b( Current Liabilities Current liabilities are those which are repayable within a year. For example, creditors for goods purchased, short term loans etc. ","238 c( Contingent liabilities It is an anticipated liability which may or may not arise in future. For example, liability arising for bills discounted. Contigent liabilities will not appear in the balance sheet. But shown as foot note. 12.4.4 Marshalling of Assets and Liabilities The term ‘Marshalling’ refers to the order in which the various assets and liabilities are shown in the balance sheet. The assets and liabilities can be shown either in the order of liquidity or in the order of permanence. a( In order of liquidity Liquidity means convertability into cash. Assets will be said to be liquid if it can be converted into cash easily, they are placed at the top of the balance sheet. Liabilities are arranged in the order of their urgency of payment. The most urgent payment to be made is listed at the top of the balance sheet. b( In order of permanence This order is exactly the reverse of the above. Assets and liabilities are recorded in the order of their life in the business concern. 12.4.5 Balance Sheet Equation An important thing to note about the Balance Sheet is that, the total value of the assets is always equal to the total value of the liabilities. This is because the liability to the owner - capital, is always made up of the difference between assets and liabilities. Thus, Assets = Liabilities + Capital or Capital = Assets - Liabilities While preparing the trial balance in case it does not tally the difference is transferred to an imaginary account called as suspense account. In case the suspense account is not closed before the preparation of the final accounts then it has to be placed in the balance sheet, so that it can be rectified later. If suspense account has a debit balance it will appear as the last item in the asset side. In case it shows a credit balance it will appear as the last item in the liability side.
